        <h3>Hii Customers</h3>
        <p>Optimal organisation of storage rooms, ensuring that food is stored
            according to its group and nature, improves productivity in the kitchen while
            also reducing hygiene-health risks.
            
            It is essential to separate cooked foods or those ready for consumption
             from those that are still raw and, whenever possible, it is a good idea 
             to assign the zones according to the type of food, in separate cold rooms.
            
            It is advisable to have separate cold rooms for different types of
             foods. If it is not possible to store vegetables that are to be 
             cooked in a separate cold room from those to be eaten raw, the
              recommendation is to place fruit and vegetables that are going 
              to be cooked (roasted, boiled, stewed â€¦) at the bottom of the 
              cold room and fruit and vegetables for direct consumption at the top part.</p>

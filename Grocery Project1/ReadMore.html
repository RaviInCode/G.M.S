        <h3>Hii Customers</h3>
        <p>Setting aside a specific zone for exchanging goods.

             There should be an area set aside for receiving/returning
              goods (specific zone, table, marked floor area…) located near 
              to the goods entrance door, separated physically or provisionally
               from the rest of the areas.
            Removing packaging from raw materials (cardboard box, plastic bag). 
            This is the outermost packaging used during distribution and 
            transport of the food, which  may or may not come with further wrapping.
            Containers that cannot be removed and that have been in
             contact with the exterior during the delivery process
              should be completely disinfected.
            In the case of fresh produce,
             such as vegetables, change them from the supplier’s container to a clean,
              disinfected container in the reception zone.
            Mark containers used for preserving and storing foods
             with all the necessary information to be able to guarantee 
             traceability of all the products.

                The aim in washing vegetables is to get rid of any soil, stones, insects,
                 pesticides, etc. that may still be on the vegetables.
                Wash fruit and vegetables under cold running water,
                 especially any that are going to be eaten raw and unpeeled.
                Remove any spoiled or bruised parts of fruit and vegetables.
                Do not work with washed fruits and vegetables on the same surface
                 as those that have not yet been washed.
                Use specific brushes to clean foods with tough skins or some
                 vegetables such as cucumber, courgettes..</p>
